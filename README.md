# The Game Store (Project 1)
By Ryan Tavares

### About
This is a command-line interface application that simulates an online video game store with many users. It performs CRUD operations on a relational database using MySQL. 

The database is initialized with data from Steam's Web API to provide a substantial amount of realistic data (Steam is an online video game storefront). Only games with an ESRB maturity rating or a Metacritic score are included.

### Run
To run this application
- Set up a MySQL server on your device
- Create a 'mysql_config.py' file in the root directory and paste the following code, replacing the string values with your MySQL server information
```
user = 'your_username_here'
password = 'your_password_here'
host = 'your_host_here'
```
- Run main.py
